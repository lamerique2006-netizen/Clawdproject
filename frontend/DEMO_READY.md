## 💬 Expected Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: Yes! The frontend is production-ready. Just needs to connect to your Python backend API and add real payment processing.

**Q: How long did this take?**
A: 2 hours from zero to complete MVP. Built with Next.js 15 best practices.

**Q: Can you add features?**
A: Absolutely! The code is clean and easy to extend. User profiles, batch processing, team features - all possible.

**Q: Will it scale?**
A: Yes. Deploys to Vercel (infinite scale). Backend can scale independently.

**Q: What about security?**
A: Frontend auth is localStorage for MVP. For production, we'll use Firebase or Auth0 + secure sessions.

**Q: How much does it cost to host?**
A: Vercel's free tier includes this app. With scale, maybe $20-50/month for edge functions.

**Q: When can we launch?**
A: This week if backend is ready. Otherwise next week. Deployment is literally one click on Vercel.
